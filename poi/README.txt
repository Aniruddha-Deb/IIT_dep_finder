Every JEE(A) Roll number is made of 7 digits:

 ABCDEFG

The first 4 (ABCD) are the centre code, while the last 3 (EFG) indicate the 
person's roll no. in that centre. The first digit (A) indicates the zone in which
the centre is located.

Example: Consider AIR 1's roll no (1054133) 
- first digit is 1 => Zone is Bombay zone
- first 4 digits are 1054 => Centre is iDZ Powai (D)
- Last 3 digits are 133 => roll no relative to that centre
